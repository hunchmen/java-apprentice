Java Exceptions
>* When building a Java application of any complexity. One must account for thefact that it's execution will not always go smoothly, sooner or later, some error will be encountered and Java's way of handling this is to quote unquote, throw an exception.

>* catching and handling such exception is something which is required to ensure that Java program continues to run even when error are encountered and that is precisely the focus of this learning path.

>* Checked exceptions which can be identified at the compile stage.

>* Unchecked exceptions which come up while the program is running.

What is an exception
>* An event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions

Checked exceptions
>* detected by the compiler , and need to be handled by the developer
>* need to be specified or handle with a try-catch block

Unchecked exceptions
>* not pointed out by the compiler - but a good developer should anticipate and handle them
>* can be addressed by fixing bugs in the code or by setting a try-catch block
